# Hey there! 👋

I'm just an average dev who *thinks* about launching a huge startup someday. But for now, I mostly write code, drink absurd amounts of tea ☕, and pretend I'm being productive while playing video games 🎮.

### 💡 What I Do (or at least try to):
- Build half-cooked apps that may or may not work 💻
- Experiment with new tech and then wonder why it broke 🚀
- Only dreaming about *the next big idea* (execution? What’s that?) 🏗️
- Break everything I touch ⚡

### 🎯 Interests (Other than procrastination):
- **Software Development**: Full-stack, mobile apps, and whatever ChatGPT or DeepSeek recommends
- **Gaming**: Because debugging isn't frustrating enough
- **Tea**: The only reason my code compiles

### 📫 Let's Connect (Or just stalk me online):
- Website: [mohsinkamalakbar.netlify.app](#)

Always happy to chat, collab, or just rant about broken code and gaming rage quits! 🚀
